      <description>while writing go this morning, I found that the wrong code are not under lined by red line This is really difficult for me and time consuming to keep writing. After 1 hour of wasting time trying to figure out what happened, I decide to kill it all and start again. Hope this will be helpful for those who wants to complete remove vscode on their mac
